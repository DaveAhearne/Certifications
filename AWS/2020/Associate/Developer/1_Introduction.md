# Introduction

## Background 

The developer associate exam is now very different to the solutions architect qualification so while previously there was more overlap its worth studying both courses indepedently

Things this course covers:
* IAM and what it means
* EC2
* S3 
* Serverless computing
* Using other serverless services such as polly for text to speech conversion
* DynamoDB
* KMS
* Application services like SNS & SQS

General development lifecycle stuff such as:
* Continuous integration
* Continuous deployment
* Code Commit & Code Pipelines
* Advanced Identity Management

## For Previous Cloud Architect Certificate Holders

There is *some* overlap between the courses, however not as much as there used to be. It used to be that you could just do the dynamodb section of the developer course and sit both exams however **this is no longer the case**

The new developer exam **is the most difficult associate level exam today**

However if you do want to skip portions the portions to skip are:
* Basic Identity Access management - Because it covers things like how to set up users/groups which has been covered before
* Basic EC2 stuff - Because it covers basic things like setting up simple instances, connecting to them etc.
* **Parts** of the servless websites and Alexa Skills - If you've done it in the solutions architect course before, *you will need to do the parts that concern X-Ray & Step Functions*
