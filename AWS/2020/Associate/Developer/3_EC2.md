# Beginners Guide to EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

## EC2 101
Elastic Compute Cloud or EC2 is a web service that **provides virtual machines on demand in the cloud** meaning you can get new machines in minutes rather than the days and weeks of ordering physical hardware in the days of old

You can scale in two major ways with EC2:
* Horizontally - By spinning up new instances of EC2 to deal with load
* Vertically - By changing their type to give them access to more performant hardware

EC2 changes the game in terms of economics *you pay for what you need right now* rather than going out and making a big capex purchase all in one go including what you assume potential future use will be *(Prevents Overprovisioning)*

### Pricing Options
There are few different ways of paying for EC2 depending on how much stability you want, these are:
* On Demand - You pay a fixed rate by the hour/second and *you don't make any commitments in terms of time or use*
* Reserved - Reserves capacity for you, you enter into a contract with Amazon about how long you will keep the EC2 around for and in exchange you get a discount depending on the length of the contract of 1 to 3 years with a variable amount upfront *(Longer term = greater discount)*
* Spot - You bid on instance capacity like a stock market, if your workload supports this kind of flexibility in terms of being able to be turned on/off randomly but you want to save money this is a good option **however there is no guarantee that your workload will be run if your bid price is too low**
* Dedicated Hosts - A physical EC2 server that is dedicated for your use, these are typically used to conform to existing server-bound licence agreements for software

Windows instances are typically priced by the hour, Linux instances are typically by the second *however this may change*

On-Demand is typically good for users that want *flexibility* who *dont want long term costs* or support so things like running up a lot of machines for testing something *that can't be stopped or interrupted* or prototyping building software for example

Reserved is good if you have *long term stable load* this makes it good for things like a stock of *base web servers* with extra being on demand to cope with spikey load for example. Entering into a contract means that you *can reduce your overall cost for the length of the contract* - You can also have convertible reserved instance meaning that *you can change attributes of the virtual machine, as long as it results in the creation of an instance of equal or greater value* e.g. A very CPU intensive machine to a very memory intensive machine. With reserved you can also have **Sheduled Reserved Instances** where you reserve machines *for a specific time window* for example a holiday week/day or particular event such as the World Cup

Spot instances are *for applications that can have variable start and end times*, typically for tasks that can be broken up into very small scale steps that can be started and stopped whenever. This is typically *for applications that are only feasible at very low compute costs* e.g. Genomics, Pharmaceutical companies, Chemical companies, Bitcoin mining at 3am on a Sunday morning

**If a spot instance is terminated by EC2, you are NOT charged for the partial hour - If you terminate the instance yourself you will be charged for the complete hour**

Dedicated hosts are typically used for *regulatory requirements or licencing agreements for software* where you pay by the server, or you want to garentee your own hardware *to prevent noisy neighbours stealing your I/O* or for *legal reasons e.g. not being allowed to use multi-tenant virtualization*, it **can be purchased on demand, or as a reservation**

### EC2 Instance Types
You **do not** need to memorize all of these for the associate exams (Some of the higher tier ones you may do depending on specialization), but there are a few that are typically used fairly often

**The number next to the letter refers to the generation, the letter refers to the type**, you won't ever be tested on the generation of the machines, just their types

| Family | Speciality                    | Use Case                                                           |

| R4     | Memory optimized              | Memory intensive apps or databases                                 |
| M5     | General purpose               | Application servers                                                |
| C5     | Compute optimized             | CPU intensive applications or databases                            |
| P3     | Graphics/General purpose GPU  | Machine learning or Bitcoin Mining                                 |
| X1     | Memory Optimized              | SAP HANA, Apache Spark, etc.                                       |

A good mnemonic for remembering them is FIGHT DR MC PX, imagine fighting a scottish doctor that wants to give you photos of his holiday

### EBS (Elastic Block Storage)

EBS or **Elastic Block Storage is Amazon's equivalent of virtual hard disks**, you can treat these as normal hard disks in terms of creating a filesystem on then, running a database etc. You use them by *attaching them to an EC2 Instance*, **EBS Volumes get spread across an Availability Zone and replicated to prevent you from losing data due to a hardware failure**

The EBS that is attached to your EC2 instance where the operating system is installed is called the **root device volume**, but you can add other drives on top of that one

The types of EBS volumes are:
* General Purpose SSD (GP2) - Middle of the road cost/performance SSD, *3 IOPS per GB up to 10,000* and burst to 3000 IOPS for drives larger than 3.3TB
* Provisioned IOPS SSD (IO1) - For I/O intensive applications e.g. databases, *to be used if you need more than 10,000 IOPS*, can provision *up to 20,000 IOPS*
* Throughput Optimized HDD (ST1) - Magnetic Non-SSD, used for big data/data wharehousing/log processing etc, **Cannot be a boot volume/root device volume**
* Cold HDD (SC1) - Magnetic Non-SSD, Lowest cost for infrequently accessed workloads, used for a file server, **Cannot be a boot volume/root device volume**
* Magnetic (Standard) - Magnetic Non-SSD, *Lowest cost of all EBS volumes*, good for a cost critical design on an infrequently accessed workload **Is the only bootable magnetic EBS type, however its a legacy type**

## EC2 Lab

The first thing you'll want to do before you start creating EC2's and other resources is to go to the top right hand corner of the AWS Console and *change the region to something thats geographically close to you* in order to reduce latency. *If you want the latest features do your work in N.Virginia*, however bear in mind that **different reigeons may have different prices for services**

### To set up a basic EC2 instance
1. Go to the EC2 dashboard from the AWS Console
2. Click the "Launch Instance" button

Instances are created from **Amazon Machine Images** or AMI's, these are a bunch of different disk images loaded with various operating systems and some are pre-loaded with software set up and configured for you, *some of them cost money in licencing whereas others are free to use*

The main list are the images that Amazon themselves maintain, however if you look on the tab to the left hand side you will see **AWS Marketplace** and **Community AMI's** these are third party AMI's and Community submitted AMI's that you can choose that may incur a cost

3. Choose the Amazon Linux AMI - This is an image created by Amazon that includes some basic tooling on a linux environment that is free to use from a licencing perspective

4. Choose the instance type - This is when we choose what instance family we want to use from the letters from before to suit our workload

5. Configure the instance details - Here we change details about *how* the EC2 will run such as details about enabling spot pricing, how many instances you want to spin up, networking details for the machine, IAM roles it should run under etc.

6. Select any extra storage we'd like to add - Here at the top we can see and change our root device volume to any one of the other bootable types or change its size, we can also add additional drives with "Add New Volume"

7. Add tags - Tags are an optional step that lets you tag your resources with details that help organise and view them later on so you can ask questions like "What resources is this project using?", "How many EC2's has the dev team created?"

8. Configure Security Groups - **Security groups are a virtual firewall** in that on top of the existing virtual network protection we can also define rules that say what services can talk inbound or outbound to our machine on what ports, *You can also restrict the ports by IP access to certain ranges or just your IP*

9. Press Review and launch, make sure that you're happy and then click "Launch" to create the EC2 Instance
