# Beginners Guide to EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

## EC2 101
Elastic Compute Cloud or EC2 is a web service that **provides virtual machines on demand in the cloud** meaning you can get new machines in minutes rather than the days and weeks of ordering physical hardware in the days of old

You can scale in two major ways with EC2:
* Horizontally - By spinning up new instances of EC2 to deal with load
* Vertically - By changing their type to give them access to more performant hardware

EC2 changes the game in terms of economics *you pay for what you need right now* rather than going out and making a big capex purchase all in one go including what you assume potential future use will be *(Prevents Overprovisioning)*

### Pricing Options
There are few different ways of paying for EC2 depending on how much stability you want, these are:
* On Demand - You pay a fixed rate by the hour/second and *you don't make any commitments in terms of time or use*
* Reserved - Reserves capacity for you, you enter into a contract with Amazon about how long you will keep the EC2 around for and in exchange you get a discount depending on the length of the contract of 1 to 3 years with a variable amount upfront *(Longer term = greater discount)*
* Spot - You bid on instance capacity like a stock market, if your workload supports this kind of flexibility in terms of being able to be turned on/off randomly but you want to save money this is a good option **however there is no guarantee that your workload will be run if your bid price is too low**
* Dedicated Hosts - A physical EC2 server that is dedicated for your use, these are typically used to conform to existing server-bound licence agreements for software

Windows instances are typically priced by the hour, Linux instances are typically by the second *however this may change*

On-Demand is typically good for users that want *flexibility* who *dont want long term costs* or support so things like running up a lot of machines for testing something *that can't be stopped or interrupted* or prototyping building software for example

Reserved is good if you have *long term stable load* this makes it good for things like a stock of *base web servers* with extra being on demand to cope with spikey load for example. Entering into a contract means that you *can reduce your overall cost for the length of the contract* - You can also have convertible reserved instance meaning that *you can change attributes of the virtual machine, as long as it results in the creation of an instance of equal or greater value* e.g. A very CPU intensive machine to a very memory intensive machine. With reserved you can also have **Sheduled Reserved Instances** where you reserve machines *for a specific time window* for example a holiday week/day or particular event such as the World Cup

Spot instances are *for applications that can have variable start and end times*, typically for tasks that can be broken up into very small scale steps that can be started and stopped whenever. This is typically *for applications that are only feasible at very low compute costs* e.g. Genomics, Pharmaceutical companies, Chemical companies, Bitcoin mining at 3am on a Sunday morning

Dedicated hosts are typically used for *regulatory requirements or licencing agreements for software* where you pay by the server, or you want to garentee your own hardware *to prevent noisy neighbours stealing your I/O* or for *legal reasons e.g. not being allowed to use multi-tenant virtualization*, it **can be purchased on demand, or as a reservation**

### EC2 Instance Types
You **do not** need to memorize all of these for the associate exams (Some of the higher tier ones you may do depending on specialization), but there are a few that are typically used fairly often

**The number next to the letter refers to the generation, the letter refers to the type**, you won't ever be tested on the generation of the machines, just their types

A good mnemonic for remembering them is FIGHT DR MC PX, imagine fighting a scottish doctor that wants to give you photos of his holiday
