## EC2 101

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud abbreviated to EC2, it provides resizable compute capacity (virtual machines) in the cloud. You can spin these up and tear them down in minutes

Because you can get resources closer to your demand, it stops you over-provisioning hardware because you're not contractually locked into the hardware

### EC2 Pricing Categories

* On Demand - This type will let you pay a fixed rate by the hour/minute (depending on the OS used) and has no commitment to use, so you can spin these up at a minutes notice and tear them down 3 minutes later, and you will only be charged for the time that the VM was running

This is good for low cost and flexibility,for when you have short term or spiky workloads that can't be interupted

* Reserved Instances - You enter into a contract with AWS, you commit to a period of 1/3 years and pay some or all of the cost up front, by entering into this contract you get a significant discount to the on-demand cost of a similar use period

Good for steady state applications e.g. web servers (75% off on demand price), convertible reserved instances will let you switch up to higher tiers of VM but still with the reserved discount. Sheduled reserved instances will let you reserve instances on a regular shedule e.g. I have a sale on the last friday of the month so i need more capacity every month then

* Spot - Lets you bid for instance capacity, provides a huge amount of discount *if the current prices enters the threshold you've set*, this is useful if you need a large amount of capacity at the cheapest cost but your workflow can support being periodically interrupted

Good for flexible start/end times, where they're only feasible below a certain cost threshold. If the spot instance gets outbid and shuts down, you don't get charged for the partial time it ran

* Dedicated Hosts - A physical server, good for contractual software requirements or legalalities around the restrictions of multi-tenant virtualization

### EC2 Instance Types

A mnemonic to remember the instance types available is:
FIGHT DR MC PX

* F - FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array - analytics, big data etc)
* I - IOPS (High Speed Storage - NoSql, Db's)
* G - Graphics (Graphics Intensive - Encoding, 3D work)
* H - High disk throughput (MapReduce, HDFS)
* T - T2 Micro (Lowest Cost, General Purpose - Web Server, small dbs)
* D - Dense Storage (File servers/hadoop) 
* R - Ram (Memory Optimized - Redis, memory intensive apps)
* M - Main choice for general purpose (General Purpose - Application servers)
* C - Compute Optimized (Cpu intensive apps)
* P - Pics - (Graphics - Machine learning, bitcoin etc)
* X - Xtreme Memory (Memory optimized - SAP HANA/Apache Spark)

The number next to the letter time is normally unimportant, as it just referrs the the generation of the type e.g. T2 is the second generation of the T type

### What is EBS

EBS is Elastic Block Storage, because they are block devices you can install software to them as you would a regular drive, EBS volumes are replicated inside an availability zone to protect you from drive failure

**EBS is to hard drives as EC2 is to virtual machines**, so these are just hard disks that are in the cloud that we attach to an EC2 instance *(Imagine plugging a virtual hard disk into a virtual PC)*

The EBS volume that is booted from in the EC2 instance is called the **root device volume**

### EBS Volume Types

#### General Purpose SSD (GP2)

This balances price and performance, it has a ratio of **3 IOPS per GB up to a max of 10,000** and can burst up to **3000 IOPS** for a short while if the volume is above 3334Gb

#### Provisioned IOPS SSD (IO1)

For high performance applications like large relational databases, **use this if you need more than 10k IOPS**, with this you can have a limit of **20K IOPS** per volume

#### Throughput Optimized HDD (ST1)

This is a standard magnetic disk unlike the other SSD types, its typically used for big data, warehousing and log processing. 

**This type cannot be a boot volume**

#### Cold HDD (SC1)

This is the lowest cost storage for infequently accessed workloads and is also a magnetic disk typical use case is for things like a file server. 

**This type cannot be a boot volume**

#### Magnetic (Standard)

The lowest cost of all of the EBS volume types, similar to cold HDD it is good for workloads where you have infrequent access and *the lowest storage cost is key*

**This is the only bootable magnetic volume type, but this is type is legacy and is being phased out**


## Creating an EC2 Instance - Lab

Choose a region that's close to you to start off, bear in mind that newer regions might not have all services or instance types available to you

### Launching an instance

1. Click on Ec2 under Compute in the AWS console list
2. Press the Launch Instance button
3. Choose an AMI
4. Choose an instance type (FIGHT DR MC PX), be aware that not all regions have all instance types available
5. Select the purchase option & tenancy as well as network, subnets, IAM roles and shutdown behavior
6. Configure the EBS volumes to attach to the EC2 as well as their types, IOPS required and size
7. Add any tags you require to track the allocation of the resource but this is optional
8. Configure the security group (firewall rules) to allow only the public traffic you want
9. Create the machine
10. Select or create an ssh-key pair, this is neccessary as AWS doesn't allow password access to VM's 

#### Whats an AMI?

An AMI is an **Amazon Machine Image** they're virtual ISO's provided by Amazon that are snapshots of an OS for example Amazons version of linux, RHEL, SUSE, Ubuntu, Windows Server etc.

You can bake your own version of an AMI from existing ones, including creating an AMI as part of your software deployment process for distribution

There are two types of AMI, HMV (**Hardware Virtual**) and PMV where PVM stands for **Paravirtual Machine**

* HMV - has a fully virtualized hardware and boot set, runs on top of the virtual machine without modification
* PVM - Uses a special boot loader called **PV-GRUB**, this means they can run on hardware that doesn't support virtualization but they can't use special hardware instructions

It used to be the case that PVM's had better perf than HVMs, but because of advancements in HVM virtualization this is no longer true

#### Configuring your EC2 instance

There are a number of options available when configuring your EC2 instance such as:
* The number of instances available (You can spin up multiple at once)
* To use or not use spot pricing, and the settings associated with that
* Tenancy to choose if you want your instance to run on shared hardware or more expensive single hardware
* Network/VPC
* Whether to auto assign a public ip or not
* Which IAM rule to use for security
* Shutdown behavior e.g. shutdown/terminate the instance
* Protect against accidental termination by preventing the instance deletion until you disable it

By default **each region has a default VPC** created by AWS, a VPC is a Virtual Private Cloud which is its own segragated network

The subnet is just the CIDR address block range, **one subnet is always equal to one availability zone, you can *never* have one subnet spanning multiple availability zones**

By default **Monitoring will be enabled every 5 minutes, enabling monitoring will make this more frequent to every 1 minute for detailed monitoring** but this will incur additional cost

In advanced detail **you can pass bootstrap script** for example you could pass commands to install some software and pull down your git repo and run it a.nd restart it if it fails

#### Setting up storage

Remember that only the General purpose SSD, Provisioned IOPS and Magnetic can be used as boot drives, however we can add other drives of any type

**By default the EBS volume is deleted when the instance is terminated** 

#### Security Groups

Seurity groups are just firewalls in AWS, you can define which type of application, protocol it uses, port and IP's are allowed

Typically **you will want to restrict your SSH access to your IP only to prevent the risk of misuse**

You'll get a warning if you leave the IP address open to your instance, if this is a web server you'll want to allow things like HTTP and HTTPS access

## Creating an Ec2 instance - Part 2 - Lab

### Running Ec2 Overview

If you go back to the Ec2 dashboard now you'll see that there is a running instance and a single keypair (possibly another security group if you created another one as well), clicking into the running instances link gives you an overview of all of the running EC2 instances

Details such as public dns, ip, instance id, state and type are all listed in the bottom section by clicking on the details of a single ec2 instance

Rememember that *basic monitoring provides data every 5 minutes, detailed monitoring provides data every minute but with extra cost*

#### Termination Protection 

You can see the status of termination protection in the Ec2 instance details

If you go to:
* Actions
* Instance State
* Terminate

If termination protection is enabled, the terminate button will be disabled to stop you from accidentally deleting the instance, in order to terminate the instance you will first need to disable termination protection in the instance settings

* Actions
* Instance Settings
* Change Termination Protection

#### Systems & Instances Status Checks

These checks are under the *Status Checks*  tab on a selected EC2 instance this will show the information for the two types

The first type is **System Status Checks** these are hardware level checks that amazon to by sending packets to the underlying infastructure, if this is errored it means that *there are currently issues with the underlying infastructure* and that you should wait until the issue is resolved as there is nothing that you can do

The second type is **Instance Status Checks** this checks that *traffic can get to the operating system* so if this fails you may need to reboot the instance or make configuration changes as something that you've set might be set incorrectly which is causing issues in traffic getting to the machine

### Creating Reserved Instances

To set up a contract for a reserved instance select "Reserved Instances" from the Instances accordion on the left hand tab

You can then view your existing reserved instances from here or select Purchase Reserved Instances, this will give you the various offerings and terms for purchasing a reserved instance 

### Encrypting the Root Device Volume


On the "Add Storage" page of creating a new VM, you'll see on the colum "Encrypted" that the volume type of *root* is listed as **Not Encrypted**, you'll notice that if you add additional volumes you can encrypt those by checking the checkbox to enable encryption **but encryption of root default AMI volumes is not enabled**

However, if the root encryption is something you need this is something that you can do by *creating your own AMI and encrypting the root device volume yourself* but this is not something that is supported out of the box

### Summary

* Termination protection is turned off by default
* On an EBS backed instance, the edefault actions is for the root EBS volume to be deleted when the instance is terminated
* The EBS root volume of the default ami's **cannot** be encrypted, but you can use a third party tool (bitlocker) to encrypt the root volume *when you create your own AMI's*
* Additional EBS volumes can be encrypted

## Security Groups Basics

### What Is A Security Group?

A security group is a **virtual firewall**, to control traffic to your instances, and a single instance can have one or many security groups associated with it. A security group consists of a named set of rules for example, allow https traffic from this port and these ip's might be grouped together in a "WebApplication" Security Group

A security group is your first line of defense, if you lock down the SSH to your IP via a security group it shuts down an attack vector

### Setting up and Using a Security Group

As part of creating a new EC2 instance you'll get to the screen "Configure Security Group" this is where you can select an existing security group (including the default) *or create your own*, if you select create your own you'll be prompted via a form to provide:
* A name for the security group
* A description for the security group
* A list of rules for the security group to allow the traffic from including things like Type, Protocol, Port ranges and Source IP ranges

Be aware that if you set the SSH rule to allow connections only from **my ip** and your IP is dynamically allocated then *when your IP changes, it will mismatch the rule and you will be blocked from SSH'ing to your instance*

### Viewing and Managing Existing Security Group Rules

If you select "Security Groups" from the Network & Security accordion on the left hand side you'll see the breakdown of all of the created security groups in the account

Selecting the groups individually will show you a breakdown of:
* Details of the group
* Inbound rules including protocol, ports and sources
* Outbound rules
* Any tags associated

Remember that **any changes to group rules take affect immediately**, also **security groups are stateful** this means that whenever you add a rule for traffic to come in, that traffic is also allowed back out. Be aware as well that this stateful property means that the outbound rules may be empty due to inbound rules mirroring onto the outbound

However, Acess Control Lists are *not* stateful, this means that if you add a rule to allow traffic in you must also add a rule for allowing the traffic back out


### The default security group

Every region comes with a default security group, this security group allows all traffic from all port ranges with the source being the security group, this means that *any resource added to this group will be allowed to talk to any resource inside of this group*

### Assigning Multiple Security Groups

To add Multiple security groups to an existing resource go to:
1. Actions
2. Networking
3. Change Security group
4. Add additional security groups from this screen or change any of the existing ones
5. Click Assign Security groups to complete the change

### Notes
* By default, all inbound traffic is blocked
* By default, all output traffic is allowed
* Changes to security groups are immediately active
* Multiple security groups can be attached to an instance
* You cannot have Deny rules, only Allow
* Security groups are stateful, if you allow traffic in - the same traffic is allowed back out 
* Network Access Control Lists are **not stateful** so if you allow traffic in, you also have to allow it back out
* You can't block IPs with security groups you need to do this with Network Access Control Lists

## Upgrading EBS Volume Types - Lab

A popular question with EBS volume is, "Can you have an EBS volume attached to an EC2 instance in another region/availbility zone?" The answer to this is **no** you cannot do this, they must be in the same AZ

### Upgrading EBS volumes

When you're upgrading an EBS volume, you can change its properties on the fly you don't need to stop the instance however *this is reccomended* as otherwise it might affect the files but this is unlikely, however **you cannot modify magnetic storage on the fly**

You can tell which is the root because its based on a snapshot

### Creating a Volume in another availbility zone

To create or move a snapshot to a different availability zone, if you're doing it via a snapshot:
1. Create the snapshot from the running EC2 instance
2. Create an image from it
3. Copy this image to the new AZ/Region
4. Create a new volume from this AZ

However, if you don't want to create a snapshot as part of this process you can:
1. Create an image from a running EC2 instance
2. Copy the image to the new AZ/Region
3. Create a new volume from this image in the target AZ

Snapshots are typically used as backups, wheras images are normally used to create new volumes so if you want to backup your volume first its typically better to do it as a snapshot first

By default, the root device EBS volume will be terminated **but the secondary attached EBS volume will not be deleted by default***

Remember **clean up your leftover snapshots, images and volumes** as you will be charged for the storage and these costs can add up quickly

### Tips

* Volumes exist on EBs they're virtual Hard Disks
* Snapshots exist on S3, you won't see them but they're stored there
* Snapshots are Point In Time copies of Volumes
* Snapshots are incremental
* First snapshot might take a while to create

* You should probably stop the instance before taking a root device volume snapshot *but you don't have to*
* You can create AMI's from EBS backed instances and Snapshots
* You can change volume properties on the fly

* Volumes are **always** in the same availability zone as the EC2 instance
* To move a volume from one AZ to another, take an image or a snap of it then copy it to the new AZ/Region

* Snapshots of encrypted volumes are encrypted automatically
* Snapshots restored from encrypted snapshots are encrypted
* You can **only share unencrypted snapshots**
* Created snapshots can be completely public or shared with other AWS accounts

## Creating a Windows Ec2 Instance & RAID group

### What is RAID

RAID stands for Redundant Array of Interdependant Disks there are a few important types of RAID's:
* 0 - Improves performance, lets you write the data across disks to speed it up, reduces redundancy
* 1 - Mirrors, Makes a copy of the data to another disk
* 5 - Spreads data accross disks, gives a parity bit that allows for the failure of a drive
* 10 - Combo of RAID 10, good perf and redundancy but needs lots of disks

Amazon **REALLY** discourage you from using RAID 5 in EBS, so if its the answer to a question its probably the wrong answer

You would typically create a RAID setup when you want more IOPS than AWS can provide for the size that you have, typical RAIDS on AWS are 0 or 10 for performance

### Setting up a Windows VM

Create some additional volumes in EBS when intially creating the EC2 instance to be combined into our RAID array

When you create a windows VM the username is typically *"Administrator"* and the password is generated from the supplied private key, to retrieve it:
1. Go to Actions
2. Get Windows Passwor
3. In the prompt paste in the copy of the **private** key into the area
4. Press decrypt to show the Windows Administrator Password

Windows takes a little bit longer than linux to provision initially

### Setting up a RAID in EC2

You increase IOPS by setting up a RAID array

To set up a new RAID array, go to "Disk Management" then do the following:
1. Select the partitions on the disks you want to assemble into the array
2. Delete the current content of the volumes
3. Right click on one of the drives unallocated space
4. Select one of the RAID options
5. Wait for the RAID array to be built
6. The setting under the disk name will now change to *Dynamic* and show as a single drive in the system

Depending on the RAID type selected you will see an increase in performance, redundancy or both

RAID 5 and 6 are not reccomended because the parity checking reduces by about 20-30% the IOPS available, and because disks can be cross replicated and are stored in a way safe from hardware failure anyway this is unnessesary so RAID 0 for performance and RAID 1 for mirroring are recommended instead

### Taking snapshots of RAID

When we take a snapshot, **the snapshot excludes the data in the cache** this is normally not an issue on a single volume, however if you're using RAID this can be a problem because *there are interdependencies between the volumes* so them getting out of sync can be a major problem, to solve this we need to stop applications writing to the disk, and flush all changes to the disk there are three ways to resolve this:
* Freeze the file system
* Unmount the RAID array
* Shutdown the EC2 instance

The most common one is **shut down the EC2 instance** which is something thats recommended before you take a snapshot anyway

## Creating an AMI - Lab

### Taking a snapshot of an Instance

To take a snapshot of an instance:
1. Go to the Ec2 overview page
2. Go to actions > instance state > stop
3. Wait for the instance to stop
4. Go to Volumes under the "Elastic Block Store" Accordion
5. Actions > "Create Snapshot"

Its important to stop the instance to ensure that we get a complete snapshot, after you've got a snapshot if you go to actions you can then *copy* the snapshot to a different region or availability zone if you require as part of the copy options you'll see that **there is the option to encrypt the snapshot**


### Creating Encrypted Image from a Snapshot

If you selected to encrypt the snapshot when you copied it/changed its properties, if you go to the "Snapshots" tab on the left hand side and go to:
1. Actions
2. Create Image from Snapshot

You'll see that on the settings in the table that **Encrypted** is set to true

### Setting up an instance with an Encrypted Root Device

To create an instance with an encrypted root device volume, create a new instance by going to the AMI's tab on the left hand side, pressing launch on the encrypted AMI that was previously created and following the standard steps changing settings as neccessary, when you're on the storage screen you'll see that *the root device volume is now listed as encrypted* at rest

However, remember that while we can share regular AMI's we can't share encrypted ones, this is because **the key used to encrypt/decrypt the AMI is associated with the acccount**

### The AWS Image Marketplace

If you go to launch a new instance, you'll see on the left hand side there is a tab for the **AWS Marketplace** this is a place where paid and free AMI's can be consumed to create instances from, some have a licencing fee associated with their use e.g. most Cisco images.

### Tips

* Snapshots of Encrypted volumes are automatically encrypted
* Volumes restored from encrypted snapshots are also encrypted
* You can only share unencrypted snapshots
* Snapshots can be shared with other accounts or made public or put on the marketplace

## AMI Types - EBS Root Volumes vs Instance Store

There are a number of different criteria you can choose an AMI based on, for example:
* Region
* Operating System
* Architecture
* Launch Permissions
* Storage for the Root Device (instance storage[ephemeral] or EBS backed)

### Whats an Instance store?

You'll see in small subtext on the AMI's when you go to create a new EC2 instance *"Root device type: ebs"* this is in reference to the EBS Backed Root Device Type which is the more modern and better for most workloads **however there is another type** called *Instance Storage*

You can see this AMI type by going to *Community AMI's* this gives you some additional filter parameters, Under *Root Device Type* you'll see:
* EBS (What we created before that creates a volume)
* Instance Store 

Select one of the Instance Store AMI's to create an instance of that type

### Creating an Instance Store

You'll see when you attempt to create one that *the instance types you can launch from an Instance Store AMI is more limited*

Also, when on the storage you'll see some additional notes, *you can add additional instance storage volumes, and more ebs volumes after you've launched the instance* **but you can't add more instance volumes after you've launched the instance** so if you do want more instance storage be sure to add this *before* you accept and launch the instance otherwise you'll have to recreate the instance to add the extra storage

### Whats the difference between an instance store and an EBS backed store?

Unlike an EBS store **you cannot stop an Instance store volume** you can only terminate or reboot it, this means that if you have to stop the instance store volume **it will destroy all of the data** this means that people call it Emphemeral storage

The problem with this is that sometimes on the status check the hypervisor is degraded, on an EBS backed volume we can stop and start the volume to move it to a more reliable *but with instance backed storage we cannot do this*

EBS backed storage is newer than instance storage, and are the more reliable and performant choice

If you go to the Volumes overview, and select an EBS volume you'll see that in the actions dropdown you can detach it and potentially attach it to another instance, *this is not possible with instance stores as the volumes are not listed as EBS volumes* and they're also destroyed when the instance is stopped


### Tips
* All AMI's are either EBS backed or Instance Store backed
* Root device for EBS volumes are created from EBS snapshots
* Instance stored volumes are created from an S3 template
* Instance store volumes are sometimes called *emphemeral storage*
* Instance store volumes *can't* be stopped and they get destroyed if stopped
* EBS volumes *can* be stopped
* You can reboot both and you won't lose anything
* With EBS you can keep the root device volume on instance termination, this isn't possible with instance store volumes

## Load Balancing Theory

### What is a load balancer

A virtual appliances that distributes load of a web application accross a bunch of servers so that no one server gets overloaded and fails

### Types of load balancers

There are three type of load balancers

#### Application Load Balancers

* Suitable for HTTP and HTTPS Traffic
* Operate at the Application level (7 OSI)
* Application aware
* Can use advanced request routing and specific requests to specific servers
* Can make intelligent decisions because it can inspect high level traffic

#### Network Load Balancers

* Operates at the Connect Level (4 OSI)
* Used for TCP traffic
* Used for *extreme* performance
* Handles millions of requests a second with low latencies

#### Classic Load Balancers (Legacy Elastic Load Balancers)

* Used interchangably with Elastic Load Balancers (Legacy term)
* Not reccomended to be used, use Application or Network insead
* Sits on HTTP/S traffic
* Can use layer 7 features like XForwarded and Sticky sessions
* can also use strict layer 4 load balancing for TCP protocol applications
* The layer 7 stuff isn't as intelligent as Application Load Balancing

### Load Balancer Errors & headers

#### Gateway Errors

504 is a gateway timeout, it means that **the load balancer is there, but what it's talking to isn't responding** so if you've got a server behind your load balancer and it dies, the load balancer will respond with a 504

To fix it, you just need to identify where the failure is and fix the underlying infastructure

#### Use of X-Forwarded-For

If you're behind a load balancer, the origin of the request looks like its coming from the load balancer but in some workloads *we want the actual public ip*, this is contained within the *X-Forwarded-For* header

## Load Balancers & Health Checks
