# Create serverless logic with Azure Functions

## Introduction

When designing traditional architecture strategies, you need to consider things like **server infrastructure and maintenance** up front. Serverless computing will **manage and provision infrastructure for you** so you can focus on building the application logic.

Azure functions are a key component of that by letting you run bits of code or *functions* written in a programming language you like in the cloud.

## Decide if serverless computing is right for your business needs

Serverless compute is **Function As A Service** FAAS (In comparison to Platform As A Service PAAS, and Infrastucture As A Service IAAS). You don't have to manage infrastructure and **your application is scaled automatically depending on load**

The two most common approaches are:
* Azure Logic Apps
* Azure Functions

### Azure Functions
Azure Functions are a **serverless application platform**, you write some business logic as code and can run it without provisioning infrastructure, they scale automatically and **you're only charged for the time the functions are running**. A number of different languages, tools and frameworks are supported.

#### Benefits
* Don't over-allocate resources - When load is light with traditional provisioning strategies you are paying for resources you're not 100% using, this isn't the case with Functions because your allocation will scale to load and you're only charged for what you use
* The logic is stateless - Anything without state is a great candidate for the transient nature of Functions, state can be stored in associated storage devices if needed
* Event driven - Functions only run **in response to** an event (or trigger) such as a HTTP call or a message queue event, this approach simplifies code because you wire up the triggers and you can focus on application logic
* Intrgrate well to traditional problem domains - Lots of problems can easily be mapped onto a serverless architecture to take advantage of the managed infrastructure

#### Drawbacks
* Time limits - **By default, Functions have a timelimit of 5 minutes, extendable to 10 minutes**, However if your call was initiated by HTTP trigger then you're restricted to that calls timeout of **2.5 minutes**. If you do need longer than this consider *migrating to a VM* or investigating **Durable Functions**
* Cost with high frequency - If your function is going to be executed constantly by multiple clients, it might be worth *investigating the cost and comparing it to a VM*. Also be aware that new functions app instances only get created every **10 seconds, for a maximum of 200 instances**, but each instance can handle multiple concurrent executions its not a 1-1 mapping, **different types of triggers have different scaling requirements**

## Create a Function App in the Azure portal

### Whats a Function App?
All Functions are hosted in an **execution context called a Function App**. Function apps are defined to *logically group and structure functions in a compute resource*.

Function apps have two service plans to choose from:
* Consumption Service Plan - This is the default, it will automatically scale and bill you when the functions are running, it had configurable timeouts of a default of 5 minutes up to 10 minutes
* Azure App Service Plan - This plan avoids timeouts **by having your function run continuously in a VM you define**, when using this you're responsible for managing the resources so its *technically* not serverless. **This is a better choice if your functions are used continuously or if they require more processing power or compute time**

When you are creating your Function App, **its name must be globally unique**, it will serve as the base URL of your service, **valid characters are: a-z 0-9 -**

Also note that when you create a function app, **it must be linked to a storage account**. The function app uses this storage account for internal operations like logging function executions and managing execution triggers. On a consumption plan *this is where the function code and config file are stored*

**Consumption Plan** is the serverless hosting option (You pay for what you eat)

If you click into the *Function App* itself, you will see it has a URL property in the overview, clicking this will give you a default web-page to indicate that the function app is running

## Run your code on-demand with Azure Functions

### Triggers
Functions are event driven, the type of event that starts the function is called a *trigger*, you must configure **one** trigger, the following triggers are available:
* Blob Storage - Starts when a blob is created or updated
* Cosmos DB storage - Starts when inserts or updates are detected
* Event Grid - Starts a function when an event is recieved from Event Grid
* HTTP - Starts up a function with a HTTP request
* Microsoft Graph Events - Starts a fuction in response to a webhook from Microsoft Graph, each instance of the trigger can react to one Microsoft Graph type
* Queue Storage - Starts a new function when an item is recieved on the queue, the message is provided as input to the function
* Service Bus - Starts a function in response to messages from a serveice bus Queue
* Timer - Starts a function on a shedule

*(Azure storage queues are for large amounts of data; 200TB vs 80GB, it also has a message TTL max of 7 days)*

### Bindings
A binding is a declarative way to connect data and services to functions. Bindings know how to talk to the services so you don't have to write code to do it. Every binding has a direction of read/write. *Every function can have 0 or more bindings to manage inputs and outputs*

A trigger is just a special type of input binding that also has the *capability to initialize execution*

Lets say we wanted to add a new row to azure table storage when we get a new message in the queue, we can do this by:
* Adding an Azure Queue Storage *trigger*
* Add an Azure Table Storage *output binding*

function.json:
``` 
{
  "bindings": [
    {
      "name": "order",
      "type": "queueTrigger",
      "direction": "in", // Note the direction
      "queueName": "myqueue-items", // The queue name we bind to
      "connection": "MY_STORAGE_ACCT_APP_SETTING"
    },
    {
      "name": "$return",
      "type": "table",
      "direction": "out",
      "tableName": "outTable", // the table we output to
      "connection": "MY_TABLE_STORAGE_ACCT_APP_SETTING"
    }
  ]
}
```
If we wanted to, we can change this output binding to be whatever we want:
* A SendGrid binding
* An event onto Service Bus
* Or add lots of output bindings to trigger different services at once

To see the contents of the *"function.json"* file, Go to Integrate > Advanced in the Azure Portal

**NOTE:** This file won't actually be available until you create the first trigger, Go to Functions in your Function App and add a new one to be able to navigate to the file
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-create-first-azure-function

**NOTE:** While a function app is described as a logical container for function apps that have a grouped functionality:
1. Each function will pull from the same pool of resources if its in the same function app
1. The primary deployment mechanisms all work by deploying the entire content of the function app at once

So by default **you should go for a 1-2-1 mapping between a Function App and a Function**

### Creating a function in the Azure Portal
When you create a function in the function app, you will get a quickstart selector of various templates you can use for the trigger to your function. Based on the selection you make *Azure will genearte the function code and config for you*

If you go to Functions, and then navigate to the template you created in the list, it will open up a detailed menu for that Function in the Function App. This will give you:
* The ability to edit and change the source code in the portal in the *Code + Test* menu
* A GUI overview of the integration points
* Monitoring and logging of all the executions

**Note:** By default when you create a Function App it will be limited to being called with a FUNCTION KEY, if you want it to be callable publically without the key being supplied change the trigger to be anonymous in the authorization level http://dontcodetired.com/blog/post/Azure-HTTP-Function-Authorization-with-Function-Keys

There are two main ways to test your app running:
1. Manually - Go to the overview page and hit "Get Function URL" and paste this into postman, note how the code is automatically supplied by default as a query string parameter for authorization
2. Automatically - Go to the *"Code + Test"* menu in the side and select "Test/Run" from the top menu, change the parameters how you see fit then press "Run" to execute

Things you log to the provided "context" object will show up in the logs

#### Application Insights

It seems like you get some of the basic logging automatically if you create a Function App from scratch in the portal, and it will create the Application Insights resource for you **however** it won't be enabled until you go to the function app, go to settings and **Enable Application Insights manually**

If you're doing something in Node.Js for example you'll also have to set up the SDK in your application to be able to hook into it properly https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/nodejs, only the most basicaly logging is gleaned from console logs

## Exercise - Add logic to the function app

If you want to temporarily stop a single function from being actioned on the trigger *without stopping the entire app* you can mark it as disabled, you *used* to do this by setting the disabled property on "function.json" but this has changed now (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/disable-function), instead you should prefer adding an App Setting in the format of:
```
AzureWebJobs.<FUNCTION_NAME>.Disabled
```
With a property of true/false, you can also used the "Enable/Disable" buttons in the azure portal

### Securing HTTP triggers
By default, HTTP Triggers will lety you use API keys to block unknown people calling your functions, they do this by requiring a key to be present *on each request*. **When you create a function, you set the authorization level, the default is Function**, there are three different authorization levels:
1. Function - You need a function specific API key to be provided
2. Admin - Uses a global master key
3. Anonymous - No key is required



For function keys there are two levels of access (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/security-concepts):
* Function - Only apply to the function that they're defined in, when you use them as an API key they only apply to **that** function
* Host - These apply to *all of the function in the function app*, so if you have one of these keys, you can call any function you want as long as its in the same Function App

There is a "default" key at both the function and host level

Finally, the master key *(Shown as _master in the portal)* allows access to admin level authorization level functions. **Be careful guarding this key** as noted in *"_master key grants admin access to Functions Runtime APIs."*, this provides host level access and gets administrative access to the runtime API's

**The master key cannot be revoked**

If you go to the "integration" option you can also modify which auth level is used on the trigger

To pass the Function app key:
1. Pass it as a query string param called "code"
2. Pass it as the http header "x-functions-key"

## Summary
When you're done working on a project, remember to clean up resources that you don't need anymore, while as long as you're working on a consumption plan for your Function Apps you won't be charged for the running costs so long as its not being used. You will still be potentially charged for things like data transfers and storage
