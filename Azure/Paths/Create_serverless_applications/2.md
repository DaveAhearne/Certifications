# Create serverless logic with Azure Functions

## Introduction

When designing traditional architecture strategies, you need to consider things like **server infrastructure and maintenance** up front. Serverless computing will **manage and provision infrastructure for you** so you can focus on building the application logic.

Azure functions are a key component of that by letting you run bits of code or *functions* written in a programming language you like in the cloud.

## Decide if serverless computing is right for your business needs

Serverless compute is **Function As A Service** FAAS (In comparison to Platform As A Service PAAS, and Infrastucture As A Service IAAS). You don't have to manage infrastructure and **your application is scaled automatically depending on load**

The two most common approaches are:
* Azure Logic Apps
* Azure Functions

### Azure Functions
Azure Functions are a **serverless application platform**, you write some business logic as code and can run it without provisioning infrastructure, they scale automatically and **you're only charged for the time the functions are running**. A number of different languages, tools and frameworks are supported.

#### Benefits
* Don't over-allocate resources - When load is light with traditional provisioning strategies you are paying for resources you're not 100% using, this isn't the case with Functions because your allocation will scale to load and you're only charged for what you use
* The logic is stateless - Anything without state is a great candidate for the transient nature of Functions, state can be stored in associated storage devices if needed
* Event driven - Functions only run **in response to** an event (or trigger) such as a HTTP call or a message queue event, this approach simplifies code because you wire up the triggers and you can focus on application logic
* Intrgrate well to traditional problem domains - Lots of problems can easily be mapped onto a serverless architecture to take advantage of the managed infrastructure

#### Drawbacks
* Time limits - **By default, Functions have a timelimit of 5 minutes, extendable to 10 minutes**, However if your call was initiated by HTTP trigger then you're restricted to that calls timeout of **2.5 minutes**. If you do need longer than this consider *migrating to a VM* or investigating **Durable Functions**
* Cost with high frequency - If your function is going to be executed constantly by multiple clients, it might be worth *investigating the cost and comparing it to a VM*. Also be aware that new functions app instances only get created every **10 seconds, for a maximum of 200 instances**, but each instance can handle multiple concurrent executions its not a 1-1 mapping, **different types of triggers have different scaling requirements**

## Create a Function App in the Azure portal

### Whats a Function App?
All Functions are hosted in an **execution context called a Function App**. Function apps are defined to *logically group and structure functions in a compute resource*.

Function apps have two service plans to choose from:
* Consumption Service Plan - This is the default, it will automatically scale and bill you when the functions are running, it had configurable timeouts of a default of 5 minutes up to 10 minutes
* Azure App Service Plan - This plan avoids timeouts **by having your function run continuously in a VM you define**, when using this you're responsible for managing the resources so its *technically* not serverless. **This is a better choice if your functions are used continuously or if they require more processing power or compute time**

When you are creating your Function App, **its name must be globally unique**, it will serve as the base URL of your service, **valid characters are: a-z 0-9 -**

**Consumption Plan** is the serverless hosting option (You pay for what you eat)
