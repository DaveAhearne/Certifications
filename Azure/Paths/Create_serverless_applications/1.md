# Choose the best Azure service to automate your business processes

## Identifying the technology options
Typically business processes involve multi-step, multi-persaon and multi-software package scenarios, with each process may invoke other processes, branch or loop. Processes can also take anywhere from milliseconds to weeks to finish.

Business processes are modelled in software as **workflows**, Azure has four technologies for modelling these:
* Logic Apps
* Microsoft Power Automate
* WebJobs
* Azure Functions

These technologies have four things in common:
* They all take an **input**
* They all perform an **action**
* They can all include **conditions**
* They all produce **outputs**

**These workflows can either be stared based on a shedule or a triggered event**

### Design First 

#### Logic Apps
"Logic Apps" are a service you can use to draw a workflow visually that models your business process, its a *very visual* approach to design that gives you a high level overview

If you want to work in"code" you can also dig into the JSON notation of the steps to get under the hood

Logic Apps rely on **connectors** which are interfaces to external services, Azure has a bunch built in but **you can write your own if your system exposes a REST API**

#### Microsoft Power Automate:
This is the tool for non-devs to perform automation and workflow tasks, you organise pre-built components to perform the actions you want

There are four types of flow:
* Automated - Triggered by an event
* Button - Triggered by a button click
* Sheduled - Runs on a timer
* Business process 0 Models a business process like stock ordering

**Under the hood, Power Automate runs on Logic Apps** this means that all the same connectors and actions are available

#### Comparison
* Logic Apps are for devs, wheras Power Automate is for office workers
* Logic Apps are for larger scale integration projects, Power Automate is for simple workflows
* Power Automate is GUI only, Logic Apps allow you to edit "code"
* Power Automate handles environments for you, Logic App source code and be integrated in SCM tools

### Code first

#### WebJobs and the WebJobs SDK
The **App Service**  is a cloud hosting service for web-apps and REST-ful API's. These applications are often needed for **background tasks**

Webjobs are part of the App Service that you can use to run programs or scripts automatically, there are two kinds of WebJob:
* Continuous - Runs constantly in a loop,
* Triggered - Starts manually or when sheduled to run

You can write WebJobs in **most languages you want** but the official WebJob SDK only supports .Net which provides some helper functions and classes

#### Azure Functions
Azure Functions let you run small bits of code in the cloud without thinking about infrastructure, you can write the function in **any of the supported languages**. 

One of the big drivers to functions is that **you only pay for the time the code is running** as well as the fact that **scaling happens automatically**

You can start writing a function in the portal or via SCM like GitHub or Azure DevOps, there are a number of templates to start off:
* HTTPTrigger - Executes in response to a HTTP call
* TimerTrigger - Executes on a shedule
* BlobTrigger - Executes when a new blob is added to the storage
* CosmosDBTrigger - Runs when documents are updated in the NoSQL DB

Azure functions can integrate into a huge number of different services both internally and externally to other parties

#### Comparison
* Azure functions have simpler administration and a more flexible coding model
* Azure Functions scale automatically
* You can dev and test Azure Functions in the browser
* Azure functions can be integrated into logic Apps
* Only WebJobs can be integrated into an App Service application


If you want the code to be part of an existing App Service app, its probably better to choose a WebJob, or if you want more control over object that listens for events to trigger things (JobHost)

## Analyze the decision criteria

The first big branch is if you want the workflow to be GUI tools or code, Graphical tools:
* Are easier for non devs
* Let designers and users consult the design to understand the workflow

However code tools:
* Are easier and faster for devs to use
* Hide the details of the workflow from end users

### Going the Design-First Route:
You'll chooose between Microsoft Power Automate or Azure Logic Apps, Logic Apps there is a designer GUI window but you can dig into the code so its designed more for developers

Power Automate provides extra help and templates but you can't see any of the code, so its better for people with no dev experience but domain experience

### Going the Code-First Route:
You'll choose between WebJobs are Azure Functions, **Functions should be the default choice** unless you have solid reasons otherwise this is because:
* More trigger options
* More supported languages
* Dev and test code straight in the browser
* You only pay for when your chode is executing

The only times you should consider a workflow first option is. Firstly, you've got an existing App Service application and you want to manage the workflow running *inside* that application. Secondly, you want specific customizations to JobHost that arn't supported by Functions e.g. A custom retry policy to a third-party system

**You arn't locked into one or the other, if part of your requirements need one thing and part another you can mix and match between calls to the services**
