# Chain Azure Functions together using input and output bindings

## Introduction

Suppose you want a completely server-less image processing platform using azure functions to process the image data and create a thumbnail and save it to storage

Azure functions are powerful in that they have a  number of *integrations, called bindings* with existing data sources and services. By using these bindings we can interact with services and data sources *without worrying about the implementation of data flows*

## Explore input and output binding types

The fundamental of any good program is that it takes some inputs, performs processing on them and returns an output. Bindings provide a way to abstract out the details of the input and output

### What's a binding

Bindings provide a *declarative* way to connect to data in code, meaning that you specify *what* you want, and the *how* can change under the hood but we are not concerned with it. This makes it easy for us to have **multiple bindings to different data sources** without having to worry about things like connection strings or APIs

### Types of bindings

There are two (really three) main types of binding:

* Input bindings - Provide a connection to a data **source**, we can read from these
* Output bindings - A connection to data **destination**, we can write to these
* Triggers - A special type of input binding that we can only have **one** of, these cause the function to execute#

While the binding type specifies if we are *reading or writing data*, a binding type can be used as **input, output or both**. E.g. Blob storage could have an output binding to store in another DB, but could also trigger another function. Some common bindings are as follows, but this is a small selection of all of them:

* Blob storage
* Service bus queues
* Cosmos DB
* Event hubs
* External files
* External tables
* HTTP endpoints

### Properties of bindings

There are three main properties for most of the bindings that you must set, occasionally there are more depending on the type:

* **Name** - Defines the function parameter data is accessed through, for example what property name in code we would use to get the message content from a service bus binding trigger
* **Type** - What service or data we are interacting with
* **Direction** - Which way the data flows, input or output binding?
* **Connection** - The name of the app setting key for the connection string, this keeps secrets out of app code

### Creating a binding

Bindings are defined in **JSON**, if you go to your functions config file *"function.json"* which lives in the same folder as your application code, to create a new binding in the same JSON file:

1. Create a binding in the function.json file
2. Provide the value for the "name" and "type"
3. If you're using a blob trigger, provide the path of which storage account and item to trigger on. Use the brace syntax to capture the filename and triggered blob, the name inside the braces is the function parameter to the function
4. If you're using a blob trigger, provide the "connection" setting name which is used as the key to find the connection string to the storage account
5. Set the direction to "in" as it **reads** data from the source

## Read data with input bindings

To connect to a data source we add an **input binding**, these take care of the implementation so you can connect to a variety of data sources

### Input binding types

There are lots of different binding types but *not all of them support both input and output*, to create input bindings **specify the direction as "in"**

* Blob storage - Let you read from a blob
* Cosmos DB - Uses SQL API to get documents and pass them as parameters to the function
* Microsoft Graph - Lets you read files from OneDrive, Excel and get authentication tokens to talk to Graph API
* Mobile Apps - Lets you read from mobile table endpoints
* Table Storage - You can read from table storage

### Binding expressions

* App settings
* Trigger file name
* Trigger metadata
* JSON payloads
* New GUID
* Current data and time
