# Chain Azure Functions together using input and output bindings

## Introduction

Suppose you want a completely server-less image processing platform using azure functions to process the image data and create a thumbnail and save it to storage

Azure functions are powerful in that they have a  number of *integrations, called bindings* with existing data sources and services. By using these bindings we can interact with services and data sources *without worrying about the implementation of data flows*

## Explore input and output binding types

The fundamental of any good program is that it takes some inputs, performs processing on them and returns an output. Bindings provide a way to abstract out the details of the input and output

### What's a binding

Bindings provide a *declarative* way to connect to data in code, meaning that you specify *what* you want, and the *how* can change under the hood but we are not concerned with it. This makes it easy for us to have **multiple bindings to different data sources** without having to worry about things like connection strings or APIs

### Types of bindings

There are two (really three) main types of binding:

* Input bindings - Provide a connection to a data **source**, we can read from these
* Output bindings - A connection to data **destination**, we can write to these
* Triggers - A special type of input binding that we can only have **one** of, these cause the function to execute#

While the binding type specifies if we are *reading or writing data*, a binding type can be used as **input, output or both**. E.g. Blob storage could have an output binding to store in another DB, but could also trigger another function. Some common bindings are as follows, but this is a small selection of all of them:

* Blob storage
* Service bus queues
* Cosmos DB
* Event hubs
* External files
* External tables
* HTTP endpoints

### Properties of bindings

There are three main properties for most of the bindings that you must set, occasionally there are more depending on the type:

* **Name** - Defines the function parameter data is accessed through, for example what property name in code we would use to get the message content from a service bus binding trigger
* **Type** - What service or data we are interacting with
* **Direction** - Which way the data flows, input or output binding?

### Creating a binding

## Read data with input bindings

## Write data with output bindings
