# Execute an Azure Function with Triggers

## Introduction
Function apps support triggering based on time or when a specific event occurs, these are called *triggers* they determine how an azure function is executed

## Determine the best trigger for your azure function
Function apps don't do work until something tells it to run, if we have an application that sends reminder messages but nothing ever tells it to run then the customers won't ever get reminder messages

### Triggers
A trigger is an object that defines how the azure functions are called, every function must have **exactly one trigger associated with it** if you want logic that runs under multiple conditions *you will have to create multiple functions that share the same source*


### Trigger Types
| **Type**  | **Purpose**  |
|---|---|
| Timer  |  Executes on a set interval |
| HTTP  | Executes when an HTTP request is received |
| Blob  | Executes when a file is uploaded or updated in blob storage  |
| Queue  | Executes when a message is added to azure storage queue  |
| Azure Cosmos DB  |  Executes a function when a document changes in the collection |
|  Event Hub | Executes when event hub receives a new event |

### Bindings
A binding is an abstract connection to data within your function. Bindings are *optional* and **you can have zero or more bindings**

An input binding is the data your function receives, an output binding is the data your function sends

## Run an Azure function on a schedule
If you want to do something on a set schedule e.g. Send out weekly mailshots to customers then a timer trigger with a function app is the most suitable solution

### Timer trigger
To create a timer trigger you need to supply:
1. A *timestamp parameter name*, which is an identifier to access the trigger in code
2. A schedule as a CRON expression* for the interval

### Creating a timer trigger
To create a timer trigger from an existing function app:
1. Select "New Function"
2. Select the "Timer Trigger" template
3. Specify the function name and the CRON schedule

## Execute an Azure function with an HTTP request
An HTTP trigger will execute the function when it gets an HTTP request, you can customize the HTTP triggers in various ways:
* Authorized only access controlled by keys
* Restrict which HTTP verbs are used
* Return data back to the caller
* Get data from the query string or request body
* Use route templates to modify the function URL

When you create a http trigger function, you select the language, name and *authorization level*, the authorization level is a flag on the trigger that specifies if you need an API key for authentication

### Authorization Levels

There are three main ones:

* Function - Requires a Key
* Admin  - Requires a Key
* Anonymous - **No key required**, no authorization is required

There are two types of keys that vary in their scope:

* Function - These are specific to *one function inside the function app*
* Host - Applies to *all functions inside the function app*

If your authorization is set to function level, you can use a function or a host key. If your authorization level is set higher to admin *you must supply a host key* as the function key only has a subset of access whereas the host key has a superset of access for the function app

### Creating a HTTP trigger

To create a HTTP trigger from an existing function app:

1. Select "New Function"
2. Select the "HTTP Trigger" template
3. Set the Function name and *authorization level*

If you go to the function itself, then the **integration** tab and look at the trigger to edit it, the following properties are of interest:

* "Request parameter name" - Changes what the request object being passed to your function is called ("req" by default)
* Selected HTTP methods - Controls what HTTP verbs can be used

### Calling HTTP trigger

To get the URL to call the HTTP trigger you can get it from two different places:

* Code + Test from the developer submenu - "Get function URL"
* Overview of the function - "Get Function URL"

You can then use the POST body or the query string to pass data to the function, you can also receive data from the result body of the function

## Execute an Azure function when a blob is called

If you want to fire a function when you upload or change a file in your azure blob storage container, the blob trigger is a good choice. This will allow you to invoke an action when an event happens in file storage, for example you upload some new photos or change your restaurant menu

### Azure Storage Overview

Azure Storage is the cloud storage solution that supports a wide range of data:

* Blobs (files), queues, NoSQL
* Its Highly available
* Secure
* Scalable
* And managed for you so you don't have to deal with setting up infra

#### Azure Blob Storage

The blob storage part is the part of azure storage that specializes in storing objects, large amounts of unstructured data, its good at:

* Storing files
* Serving files
* Streaming video and audio
* Logging data

There are three main *types* of blobs:

* **Block** - The most common type, let you store text or binary data efficiently
* **Append** - Optimized for append operations like adding to a log file
* **Page** - Made of pages, optimized for random read/write

### Creating a Blob Trigger

To create a blob trigger, you make a storage account and give it a location that the trigger monitors, to create a blob trigger:

1. Select "New Function"
2. Select the "Blob Trigger" template
3. Select which storage account you want to link it to in the dropdown
4. Give it a path to watch on

#### Path explained

The path is what file path inside the storage account to watch, by default the path is:

```
samples-workitems/{name}
```

The first part before the "/" is which blob container to watch, the second part "{name}" is a wildcard that means *"any type of file will cause the trigger to invoke"*, we can make this more specific for example:

```
samples-workitems/{name}.txt
```

The "name" **is received as a parameter in the azure function** called "name", the blob trigger will fire when it sees activity at the location you specify with a name that matches what you requested
